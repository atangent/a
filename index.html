        <h4>30 seconds with Amy Tang 🍓</h4>
        <p>
          I’m looking for roles in software engineering, venture creation, venture capital, and/or generalist startup roles doing a bit (a lot) of everything. 
          <br>
          <h5>strong technical background</h5>
          I’m a software engineer with ~1year of full time experience. Graduated in May 2023 with a Bachelor’s in CS from Queen’s University in Canada. 
          <br><br>
          During my undergrad, I completed 7 software engineering internships (~24 months total) writing production-level code, designing API’s & software architecture, building with LLM’s, scaling distributed systems, supporting cancer research with ML/AI, and had lots of fun bringing ideas to life. 
          <br><br>
          <h5>entrepreneurial spirit</h5>
          I value fast paced environments and driving projects from idea to launch. In 2020-2021, I built the first-ever MVP on an early stage startup (2 founders + me) as their first technical hire. That was when I fell in love with the ambition that is at the core of entrepreneurship. An adrenaline junkie at heart (I ski with broken bones) — I seek opportunities that will mimic that same rush, of moving at electrifying speeds & achieving a lot in little time.
